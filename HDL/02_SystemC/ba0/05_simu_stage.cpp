The systemC application has three phases/stages of operation:
  1. Elaboration: execution of statements prior to sc_start().
    The primary purpose is to create internal data structures to support the semantics of simulation.
    During elaboration, the parts of the module hierarchy (modules, ports, primitive channels, and processes) are created, and ports and exports are bound to channels.
  2. Execution: further break-down to two stages:
    a) Initialization
      simulation kernel identifies all simulation processes and place them in either a runnable or waiting process set.
      All simulation processes are in runnable set except those requesting "no initialization".
    b) Simulation
      is commonly described as a state machine that schedules processes to run, and advances simulation time. It has two internal phases:
        1) evaluate: run all runnable processes one at a time. Each process runs till reaches wait() or return. Stops if no runnable processes left.
        2) advance-time: once the set of runnable processes is emptied, simulation enters advance-time phase where it does:
          a) move simulated time to the closest time with a scheduled event
          b) move processes waiting for that particular time into the runnable set
          c) return to evaluation phase
        The progression from evaluate to advance-time continues until one of the three things occurs. Then it moves to the cleanup phase.
          a) all processes have yielded
          b) a process has executed sc_stop()
          c) maximum time is reached
  3. Cleanup or post-processing: destroy objects, releases memory, close open files etc.

Four callback functions are called by the kernel at various stages during elaboration and simulation. They have the following declarations:
  1. virtual void before_end_of_elaboration(): called after the construction of the module hierarchy
  2. virtual void end_of_elaboration(): called at the very end of elaboration after all callbacks to before_end_of_elaboration have completed and after the completion of any instantiation or port binding performed by those callbacks and before starting simulation.
  3. virtual void start_of_simulation(): 
    a) called immediately when the application calls sc_start for the first time or at the very start of simulation, if simulation is initiated under the direct control of the kernel.
    b) if an application makes multiple calls to sc_start, start_of_simulation is called on the first call to sc_start.
    c) called after the callbacks to end_of_elaboration and before invoking the initialization phase of the scheduler.
  4. virtual void end_of_simulation():
    a) called when the scheduler halts because of sc_stop or at the very end of simulation if simulation is initiated under the direct control of the kernel.
    b) called only once even if sc_stop is called multiple times.
